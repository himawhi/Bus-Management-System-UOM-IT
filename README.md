# Bus-Management-System-UOM-IT
Level_02_Software_Project

This is a smart bus management system to handle issues in public bus transportation. There are 3 main roles in the system; Bus Driver, Registered and unregistered passengers,and Depo Administrator. Drivers can mark their attendance to work on daily basis and report their issues in case of bus breakages. Also he can view their turn schedules through the system.
Registered passengers can search buses to reach their intended destinations and select a specific bus in specific time slot to receive notifications about the bus. As live location tracking is there passengers can receive notifications about locations of the bus and go to the bus halt on time.
Depo administrator can hanldes issues in bus transportation, make daiy turn schedules and handle bus breakages. He can use chat application to send alerts and messages directly to bus drivers in handling issues.
My part in the project is designing driver interface and functionalities in driver side. We used Springboot, MongoDB and React to build the web application.
